 * This is the UPA Interactive Provider Training series of the UPA Training Suite
 * applications. The purpose of this application is to show step-by-step 
 * training how to build a UPA OMM Interactive Provider using the UPA Transport layer.
 *
 * Main h header file for the UPA Interactive Provider Training application. It is a 
 * single-threaded client application.
 *
 ************************************************************************
 * UPA Interactive Provider Training Module 1a: Establish network communication
 ************************************************************************
 * Summary:
 * An OMM Interactive Provider application opens a listening socket on a well-known 
 * port allowing OMM consumer applications to connect. Once connected, consumers 
 * can request data from the Interactive Provider.
 * 
 * In this module, the OMM Interactive Provider application opens a listening socket 
 * on a well-known port allowing OMM consumer applications to connect.
 *
 * Detailed Descriptions:
 * The first step of any UPA Interactive Provider application is to establish 
 * a listening socket, usually on a well-known port so that consumer applications 
 * can easily connect. The provider uses the rsslBind function to open the port 
 * and listen for incoming connection attempts.
 * Whenever an OMM consumer application attempts to connect, the provider uses 
 * the rsslAccept function to begin the connection initialization process.
 * 
 * For this simple training app, the interactive provider only supports a single client. 
 * 
 *
 ************************************************************************
 * UPA Interactive Provider Training Module 1b: Ping (heartbeat) Management
 ************************************************************************
 * Summary:
 * In this module, after establishing a connection, ping messages might 
 * need to be exchanged. The negotiated ping timeout is available via 
 * the RsslChannel. If ping heartbeats are not sent or received within 
 * the expected time frame, the connection can be terminated. Thomson 
 * Reuters recommends sending ping messages at intervals one-third the 
 * size of the ping timeout.
 *
 * Detailed Descriptions:
 * Once the connection is active, the consumer and provider applications 
 * might need to exchange ping messages. A negotiated ping timeout is available 
 * via RsslChannel corresponding to each connection (this value might differ on
 * a per-connection basis). A connection can be terminated if ping heartbeats 
 * are not sent or received within the expected time frame. Thomson Reuters 
 * recommends sending ping messages at intervals one-third the size of the ping timeout.
 * Ping or heartbeat messages are used to indicate the continued presence of 
 * an application. These are typically only required when no other information is 
 * being exchanged. Because the provider application is likely sending more frequent 
 * information, providing updates on any streams the consumer has requested, 
 * it may not need to send heartbeats as the other data is sufficient to announce 
 * its continued presence. It is the responsibility of each connection to manage 
 * the sending and receiving of heartbeat messages.
